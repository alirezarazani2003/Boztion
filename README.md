# 🎙🤖 Boztion — Emotion Recognition from Voice

**Boztion** is an AI system inspired by the surprising ability of goats to recognize human emotions **just by hearing their voice**.  
If a goat can do it, surely AI can too!

Boztion analyzes voice tone to detect the emotional state of a speaker — happy, sad, angry, and more — all through the power of machine learning and signal processing.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 🎤 **Voice Tone Analysis**  
- 😄 **Emotion Detection** (multiple emotion classes)  
- 🧠 **Non-intrusive Input**: works with microphone or pre-recorded audio  
- 📈 **Outputs**: Detailed CSV reports with time ranges and dominant emotions  
- ⚙️ **CLI-first design** – perfect for integration in various applications

## 💡 Use Cases

- Chatbots & conversational agents  
- Customer service call analysis  
- Mental health & wellness apps  
- Accessibility tools

## 📚 Science Behind It

Inspired by animal cognition research — especially a study that shows goats respond differently to happy or angry human voices — Boztion applies similar principles using modern AI tools.

## 🚧 Project Status

Boztion is in active development. Stay tuned for more features, models, and real-time emotion tracking.
